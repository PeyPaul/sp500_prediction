# S&P 500 Prediction with ML and Sentiment Analysis

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts S&P 500 fluctuations.

## The Dataset

The dataset consists of article headlines and various financial indices covering the period from 2010 to 2011. The initial dataset's articles were insufficient, so we scraped additional news from financial newspapers and extracted sentiments using the Mistral LLM.

## Results 

Our models achieved **67% accuracy** on the validation dataset, which is an impressive score given the unpredictable nature of financial markets.

## Usage

A synthesis of all the work we did is available in `./final_project/Work_Synthesis.ipynb`.  
The folder `initial_stuff` contains the materials we were initially provided.  
The folder `final_project` consolidates various components of our work.
